# Softplan's Open Source Policy

This document describes the open source policy at [Softplan][]. This Policy must be followed by any staff member when using, contributing, and creating and releasing Open Source Software.

## Definition

**Contribution** is a tangible product created by individuals that help advance an Open Source Software project. Examples of contributions include: programming, bug fixes, issue reports, feature suggestions, and documentation.

**Open Source Software** (OSS) is "software that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone" (http://opensource.org/) and is distributed under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative, e.g. one of the licenses recommended below.

A **Project** — specifically, an Open Source Software project — includes the entirety of collaborative activity, such as planning, discussion, design, documentation, and programming, that furthers the development of a piece of Open Source Software.

**Software** refers to computer programs, or any set of instructions intended to be executed by a machine, including (but not limited to) executable files, libraries, and scripts.
